[Cursor] Add screenshot verification functionality

Added screenshot verification functionality with the following components:
1. Screenshot capture using Playwright (screenshot_utils.py)
2. LLM-based verification using OpenAI and Anthropic (llm_api.py updates)
3. Unit tests for screenshot capture and LLM verification
4. End-to-end test with a test server
5. Updated requirements.txt with Playwright dependency

The feature allows capturing screenshots of web pages and verifying their appearance using LLMs.
